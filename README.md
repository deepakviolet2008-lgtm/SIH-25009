SIH 25009: Gamified Environmental Education Platform for Schools and Colleges

## Problem Creater's Organization

## Theme
Department of Higher Education

## Problem Description
### Problem Description
<ul>
  <li>Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges. Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.</li>
  <li>There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.</li>
</ul>

### Impact
<ul>
  <li>As future decision-makers, students must be environmentally literate and empowered to take meaningful actions. Without innovative education methods, we risk raising a generation unaware of sustainability challenges.</li>
  <li>An interactive, practical approach to environmental learning will foster long-term behavioral change, local involvement, and a ripple effect across families and communities. This aligns with India's SDG goals and NEP 2020's emphasis on experiential learning.</li>
</ul>

### Expected Outcomes
<ul>
  <li>A gamified mobile/web platform or app that teaches students about environmental issues through interactive lessons, challenges, quizzes, and real-world tasks (e.g., tree-planting, waste segregation).</li>
  <li>Tracking of eco-points, enabling school-level competitions.</li>
  <li>Rewards for sustainable practices through digital badges and recognition.</li>
</ul>
